    <p>
      Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in
      biological systems. <br />
      It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'),
      Adenine ('A'), <br />
      and Thymine ('T').<br />
      <br />
      Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA
      differs slightly from <br />
      DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is
      replaced by another <br />
      nucleic acid Uracil ('U').<br />
      <br />
      Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.<br />
      <br />
      For example:<br />
      <br />
      "GCAT" => "GCAU"<br />
      The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be
      empty. <br />
      All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever
      consist <br />
      of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.<br />
